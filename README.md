## Phase 1: Create the Basic App
This basically covers the AWS Developer certification
- establish a IaC setup using CDK
- simple React + Amplify app with a basic Cognito registration+authentication
- setup a BE using SAM and expose it using AppSync
- setup a build pipeline for the FE+BE using Code Pipeline

## Phase 2: Design the Data Processing Pipeline
This is where we practice for the AWS Data Analytics specialty
- use Glue and Athena to analyze our candidates data
- use Glue to populate the search database

## Phase 3: Machine Learning
This is the icing of the cake where we obviously would get the Certified Machine Learning Specialization certificate
- use NLP to tag our source data
